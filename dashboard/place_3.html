    The royal city of Udaipur has been the capital of Mewar for several centuries. The city has a legend behind its establishment. Once during his hunting expedition, Maharana Udai Singh met a holy sage in the Aravalli ranges. The sage directed the king to create a kingdom in this fertile valley, which would be protected by the high-rising Aravallis. Consequently, Maharana Udai Sing established Udaipur in 1553 AD.

Chittorgarh was the former capital of Mewar Kingdom and Maharana Udai Singh was the successor of the Sisodia clan, the descendants of the Sun God, who believed themselves to be the worldâ€™s oldest ruling family. They were known to be the most powerful warrior clan in Rajasthan. The capital was also moved to Udaipur from Chittorgarh, because of constant enemy attacks.

In the year 1568, the Mughal Emperor attacked Chittor and to keep away from his clutches, Udai Singh shifted his kingdom to Udaipur, which was a safer place. Since then, Udaipur has gotten developed into a modern city.

Udaipur was the capital of Mewar, until it became the princely state of British India in the year 1818. After independence in 1947, the Maharaja of Udaipur granted Udaipur to the Indian Government and Mewar was merged into the Rajasthan state. Currently, Udaipur is an important city of Rajasthan. It is famous for its charming surroundings, its regal history, beautiful palaces and monuments, striking lakes and equally fascinating temples.<div id="textbox">
